# CISSP Mnemonics

There are so many things to memorize for the CISSP. This is a collection of things I've found from others or made up to help me memorize the immense amount of things in this exam. Some of the ones I made up are very silly but that tends to help me remember them. I have found that I would remember the silly thing but not what it actually applies to so I sometimes added little sayings before the mnemonic to help remember what it was for as well.
